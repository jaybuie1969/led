#Raspberry Pi

This micropython project was written to run on a Raspberry Pi microcontroller

It iterates over a set of data frames and displays the elements of the data frame in quick and easy GREEN / YELLOW / RED colors

All of the Python files in this directory need to be uploaded to the microcontroller in order for it to run
main.py should automatically execute as soon as powe is applied to the circuit

The source CSV file has intentionally been left out of this repository because it contains company data.  There would probably be no problem since there is no context, but it is better to be safe.
